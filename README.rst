Kidney Disease Diagnosis
======================================================

We develop algorithm to predict whether patient has heart disease or not based on input features. We also compare the performance of our method with other existing machine learning methods, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Dicision Tree, Random Forest, k-nearest neighbors, and Support Vector Machines.
